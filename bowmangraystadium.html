    <h1>Bowman Gray Stadium</h1>

    <h4>An introduction...</h4>
    <p>Bowman Gray Stadium is one of many historical sites in Winston-Salem that I am not quite as familiar with, but it seems to pop up in my life through various means.</p>
    
    <h4>A race track...</h4>
    <p>The Stadium was built in 1937 as part of many public works projects across the nation to help provide jobs and boost the economy during the Great Depression. It was named after Bowman Gray, former CEO of <a class="highlight" href="reynoldsbuilding">R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company</a>. The very first event at the stadium was a football game in 1938 between Wake Forest University and Duke University. This was prior to Wake Forest University&#39s official move to the city of Winston-Salem. The first car race took place in 1939 on a dirt quarter mile track using midget cars. It wasn&#39t until 1947 that the track was paved and stock car racing officially began in Winston-Salem.</p>

    <h4>Personal Encounters...</h4>
    <p>I went to Bowman Gray Stadium&#39s "Night of Destruction" which featured a race, two monster trucks and a demolition derby. I don&#39t have many clear memories of that night but my Dad captured many photos of the action that took place. Plus evidence that I was in fact at the Bowman Gray Stadium, in case my limited recollection isn&#39t enough proof.</p>

  <div class="maincontent">
    <p>I was recently attending helping out at a memorial golf tournament at Reynolds Park Golf Course (you really can never escape the name Reynolds), and I was taking pictures towards the South side of the course. It was early on a Saturday morning and I could hear the race cars practicing. I hadn&#39t realized the race track was so close but it was just behind the line of trees..</p>
    <p>It was then that I became intrigued in the stadium again and I began to realize another way that my life was connected to the Stadium. While I mentioned earlier that Wake Forest University once used the stadium for its college football team, my own high school also used it. During the 80s and 90s, Parkland High School and <a class="highlight" href="reynoldsauditorium.html">R.J. Reynolds High School</a> shared the stadium as their home field until their current stadium, Deaton-Thompson Stadium, was built in 1994. Roughly 25 years shy of when I would attend a high school football game.</p>
