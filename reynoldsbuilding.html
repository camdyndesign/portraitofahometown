    <h1>Reynolds Building</h1>

    <h4>I remember the first time I really noticed the Reynolds Building...</h4>
    <p>I was in 8th grade and my youth group was doing a scavenger hunt around the city. This was also the time I got to download Instagram for the first time, because points were awarded for posting a picture of your team in front of the place the scavenger hunt alluded to. My team won, but that's beside the point.</p>
    <p>One of the clues that I had no idea about referenced the Empire State Building, and a building in Winston-Salem that essentially served as its model or trial run. Some other people in my group knew the answer and so we rushed downtown and crossed the street to stand in a parking lot we definitely weren't supposed to be in. As you could probably guess by the title of this page, in the background was the Reynolds Building. It wasn't a building I had much knowledge or familiarity with, but I knew the name of the Empire State Building, and thus I became fascinated.</p>
    <p>My dad's office is filled with various memorabilia and trinkets including small tin men from Historic Bethabara Park and foul baseballs from the Winston-Salem Warthogs. Nearing the top of his bookshelves is a model replica of the Empire State that I believe he picked up when he visited New York. He also has frames featuring old pictures of the construction of the Empire State Building. This was all without knowing we had our own mini Empire State Building downtown.</p>
    <p class="funfact">Fun fact, I couldn't think of a word to describe the model replica, so I googled "mini empire state building" and 75 percent of Google's initial responses referenced the Reynolds Building.Fun fact, I couldn't think of a word to describe the model replica, so I googled "mini empire state building" and 75 percent of Google's initial responses referenced the Reynolds Building.</p>
    <p>The Reynolds Building was built in 1929 and designed by Shreve and Lamb, the same architectural firm that designed the Empire State Building, which began construction just one year later. In September 2022, I had the opportunity to go to New York and see the Empire State Building in person, and it's clear the connection between the two buildings.</p>

  <div class="maincontent">
    <p>Both buildings feature the same stepped design at their top. Supposedly, the Reynolds Building was used as the top (and arguably most iconic part) of the Empire State Building, while another building (the Carew Tower in Cincinnati) inspired the bottom.</p>
    <p>The Empire State Building also recognizes the Reynolds Building as its origin. In 1979 (50 years after the Reynolds Building opened) the Empire State Building's Vice President and General manager, Robert L. Timber sent an anniversary card to the building.</p>
    <p class="funfact">HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, DAD‚Äç</p>
    <p class="funfact">On the fiftieth anniversary of the Reynolds Building, we would like to offer our congratulations to the structure that served as the architectural model for New York's famous skyscraper. The Empire State Building is one of the world's wonders and we are appreciative of its roots in Winston-Salem, N.C. We hope that the Reynolds Building will continue to serve R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. well, just as the Empire State Building serves the people of New York City.</p>

      THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING</p>
  </div>


  <div class="maincontent">
    <p>Since its construction, it has received numerous awards, including "Building of the Year" by the National Association of Architects and the 1984 Art Deco Society of New York award for best restoration, in addition to being considered the tallest building in the South for 35 years! And it's right here in Downtown Winston-Salem.</p>
    <p>The Reynolds Building was initially built to serve as RJR Tobacco's headquarters in addition to having retail outlets on the first floor and other corporate offices all within its 22 floors.</p>
    <h4>I think in order to understand the Reynolds Building and Winston-Salem in general, it's important to understand the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company...</h4>
    <p>Reynolds Tobacco Co. was founded in 1875 by Richard Joshua "R.J." Reynolds. He had left his father's company in Virginia and headed to Winston-Salem, which was the nearest town with a railroad connection. He bought the company's first factory building from the Moravian Church. By the 1890s his production had increased to several million pounds of tobacco per year and the factory buildings were the largest buildings in Winston-Salem and were some of the first to have new technologies such as steam power and electric lights.</p>
    <div id="reynoldshimself">
    </div>
    <p>To this day, it stands as the second largest tobacco company in the nation. It really established Winston-Salem on the map. Winston-Salem was designated an official port of entry, despite being 200 miles from the border, due to its high rates of importing French cigarette paper and Turkish tobacco for Camel Cigarettes. It was actually the 8th largest port of entry in the United States in 1916.</p>
    <p>It also drew the attention of a number of different businesses, <a class="highlight" href="krispykreme.html">including Krispy Kreme, whose founders saw Winston-Salem on a pack of Camel Cigarettes and decided to start their doughnut business in the city</a>. And it's also the reason the city is often referred to as Camel City.</p>
    <p>Winston-Salem is often referred to as the City of Arts and Innovation, and that is in no doubt due in part to the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. While Reynolds Tobacco Co. helped establish Winston-Salem, it no longer has ownership of the Reynolds Building.They began moving their headquarters in the 1970s and eventually put the building up for sale in 2009. In 2013, it was purchased by Kimpton Hotels & Restaurant groups which would later open the Kimpton Cardinal Hotel on the lower six floors, beneath luxury apartments. On the ground floor is a restaurant named Katharine Brasserie & Bar after Katharine Smith Reynolds, the wife of R.J. Reynolds, whose philanthropy led to <a class="highlight" href="reynoldsauditorium.html">the construction of the Reynolds Auditorium</a> among many other places within the city.</p>
    <p>While the building may no longer be tied to R. J. Reynolds Tobacco or directly to the Reynolds Family, the influence and legacy of R. J. Reynolds lives on, in Winston-Salem.
