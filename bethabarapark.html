    <h1>Historic Bethabara Park</h1>

    <h4>A brief history...</h4>
    <p>Historic Bethabara is the area that was originally settled in 1753 by a group of 12 Moravian men. It was the first European settlement in the North Carolina piedmont. They named the area Wachovia (thus where the former bank got its name) which included the towns of Winston-Salem and Bethania. Bethabara was never meant to be a permanent settlement, but rather a temporary one prior to the construction and move to Old Salem in 1766, which was delayed until after the French and Indian War. The place has since been dubbed a National Historic Landmark and Local Historic District where you can visit and learn about its history.</p>

    <h4>It all started with a field trip...</h4>
    <p>Throughout Elementary School and even some in Middle School, we would often take trips to historical sites. From the Biltmore to Poplar Forest to the <a class="highlight" href="reynoldsbuilding">Reynolda House</a>, and even Bethabara Park. Bethabara Park was always a lot simpler, with fewer houses or structures and a lot of open fields, this is because many of the materials that made up its original structures were used to construct new buildings in <a class="highlight" href="reynoldsbuilding">Old Salem</a>. However, I always found it very fun to visit.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite memories from field trips to Bethabara Park was hoop rolling. Hoop Rolling is a game where you have a wood band in the shape of a hoop and a wooden stick (like a dowel). You push the hoop so it starts rolling and then use a stick to keep it rolling. It was a traditional game often played by the settlers of both Bethabara Park and Old Salem. While I failed quite a few times in my first attempts, over a few trips, I was able to practice more and was able to push the wheel over longer distances.</p>

    <h4>Bethabra is also known for hosting a number of cultural events including the Celtic Festival and the Apple Festival.</h4>
    <p>The Celtic Festival was one of my favorite events to attend. I think the first time I went was in 2008. My dad was really excited. He put on his kilt with the Davis Clan Tartan, traditional socks and even wore a rabbit fur pouch. It was really special to look at all the tents and tables for different family clans and to find names that were part of my ancestry, such as McCammon, from my mother&#39s side of the family.</p>
    <p>My mother spent part of her youth in Scotland and learned how to play the bagpipes in school, so it was really special to hear them live for the first time (something I remembered quite fondly every time the bagpiper on campus played on Sanford Mall). I also got to see the caber toss and a border collie herding sheep.</p>

  <div class="maincontent">
    <p>Not long before attending the festival, I had watched one of my classmates perform an Irish dance. I then decided that I wanted to try Irish Dance, so it was really nice getting to watch Irish dancers perform at the Celtic Festival on the Pavilion Stage, and imaging myself up there one day. The dancers were from the Rince na h&#39Eireann School of Traditional Irish Dance, the same school that I would join.</p>

    <p>Another festival that takes place at the Historic Bethabara Park is the Apple Festival. I only went once when I was much younger. It was a great experience to explore different types of apples and local crafts. I got to explore numerous different craft tables including one that was selling miniature tin soldiers. The people working the tent dressed as though they were straight from the late 1700s and it was fascinating to see them working on crafting different metal objects My dad bought a few of the tin soldiers and keeps them to this day as part of a larger collection in his office. </p>
